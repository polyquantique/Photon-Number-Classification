# PHOTON NUMBER CLASSIFICATION

Comparison of different algorithms for the classification of transition edge sensor signals.
With the development of a variety of techniques in the field of machine learning the goal is to quantify the advantages of modern classification techniques in the context of photon detection. 

## FILES

### CONFIDENCE

- `Methods_Uniform.ipynb`
- `Methods_Geometric.ipynb`
- `Methods_Large.ipynb`
- `Methods_Noise.ipynb`

### TRAINING

- `Train_PtSNE.ipynb`
- `Train_PUMAP.ipynb`

### FIGURES

- `Effect_Gaussians.ipynb`
- `Figures_General.ipynb`
- `Figures_Methods.ipynb`
- `Find_Distributions.ipynb`


## EXPERIMENTS

The different algorithms are compared in a single notebook available in :

`uniform_TES.ipynb`

The following methods are evaluated :

- Maximum Value
- Area
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Kernel Principal Component Analysis (K-PCA)
- t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
- Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)
- Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
- Isomap
- Parametric t-SNE
- Parametric UMAP


## TODO

- Include Sphinx documentation
